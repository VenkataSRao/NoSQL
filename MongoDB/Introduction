Introduction:
============

MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database.

MongoDB avoids the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas
(MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. 

First developed by the software company MongoDB Inc. in October 2007 as a component of a planned platform as a service product, 
the company shifted to an open source development model in 2009

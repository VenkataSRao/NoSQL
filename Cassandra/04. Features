Features of Cassandra


Elastic scalability:
====================
 Cassandra is highly scalable; it allows to add more hardware to accommodate more customers and more data as per requirement.

Always on architecture:
=========================
 Cassandra has no single point of failure and it is continuously available for business-critical applications that cannot

Fast linear-scale performance:
==============================
 Cassandra is linearly scalable, i.e., it increases your throughput as you increase the number of nodes in the cluster. 
 Therefore it maintains a quick response time.


Flexible data storage:
========================
 Cassandra accommodates all possible data formats including: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. It can dynamically
 accommodate changes to your data structures according to your need.

Easy data distribution:
=======================
 Cassandra provides the flexibility to distribute data where you need by replicating data across multiple datacenters.

Transaction support:
======================
 Cassandra supports properties like Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID).

Fast writes:
==============
 Cassandra was desined to run on cheap commodity hardware. It performs blazingly fast writes and can store hundreds of 
 terabytes of data, without sacrificing the read efficiency.

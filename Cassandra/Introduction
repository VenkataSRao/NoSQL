Introduction:
==============

Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. 

Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for 
mission-critical data. 

Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the 
peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.

Cassandra's data model offers the convenience of column indexes with the performance of log-structured updates, strong support 
for denormalization and materialized views, and powerful built-in caching.

Features of Cassandra:
======================

Proven:
=======
One of the largest production deployments is Apple's, with over 75,000 nodes storing over 10 PB of data. Other large Cassandra
installations include Netflix (2,500 nodes, 420 TB, over 1 trillion requests per day), Chinese search engine Easou (270 nodes,
300 TB, over 800 million reqests per day), and eBay (over 100 nodes, 250 TB)


Fault Tolerant:
================

Data is automatically replicated to multiple nodes for fault-tolerance. Replication across multiple data centers is supported.
Failed nodes can be replaced with no downtime.


Performant:
===========

Cassandra consistently outperforms popular NoSQL alternatives in benchmarks and real applications, primarily because of 
fundamental architectural choices.

Decentralized:
============

There are no single points of failure. There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster is identical.

Durable:
=========

Cassandra is suitable for applications that can't afford to lose data, even when an entire data center goes down.

Elastic:
=========

Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.

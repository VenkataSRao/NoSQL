Keyspace is the outermost container for data in Cassandra. The basic attributes of a Keyspace in Cassandra are:

Replication factor: 
It is the number of machines in the cluster that will receive copies of the same data.

Replica placement strategy:
It is nothing but the strategy to place replicas in the ring. We have strategies such as simple strategy (rack-aware strategy), 
old network topology strategy (rack-aware strategy), and network topology strategy (datacenter-shared strategy).


Column families:
 Keyspace is a container for a list of one or more column families. A column family, in turn, is a container of a collection of 
 rows. Each row contains ordered columns. Column families represent the structure of your data. Each keyspace has at least one 
 and often many column families.


The syntax of creating a Keyspace is as follows:

CREATE KEYSPACE Keyspace name WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3};

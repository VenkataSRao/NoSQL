Database is the outermost container that contains data corresponding to an application.

Row is an individual record in RDBMS.
Column represents the attributes of a relation.
RDBMS supports the concepts of foreign keys, joins.



Cassandra:
=========

In Cassandra, a table is a list of “nested key-value pairs”.
(ROW x COLUMN key x COLUMN value)
Keyspace is the outermost container that contains data corresponding to an application.
